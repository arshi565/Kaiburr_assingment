Machine Learning Program for Problem Statement
Introduction
This project is a machine learning program developed to solve a specific problem statement. The program uses various machine learning algorithms to analyze data and predict future outcomes based on the data patterns.

Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project is to predict the price of a house based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.

Data
The data used in this project was collected from various real estate websites and includes information about the features of different houses and their prices. The data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing or invalid values.

Machine Learning Algorithms
This program uses several machine learning algorithms to predict house prices, including:

Linear Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Dependencies
The program requires the following dependencies to be installed:

Python 3.6 or later
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the dependencies by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the program by running the following command: python predict_house_price.py
Follow the prompts to enter the features of the house you want to predict the price for.
Output
The program will output the predicted price of the house based on the input features.

Conclusion
This machine learning program can be used to predict the price of a house based on various features. It uses several machine learning algorithms to make predictions and can be improved by adding more features and data.
