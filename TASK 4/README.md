This is a simple implementation of a React component that fetches the servers data from the REST API using Axios, displays it in a list, and provides a form for creating new servers and a button to delete them. To use this implementation, you would need to create a new React project, install Axios and any other dependencies, and replace the App component with this code. Note that you would also need to update the URLs in the Axios requests to match your own API endpoints.
